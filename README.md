- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' — Donald Knuth. Focus on writing clear, maintainable code first; optimize only when necessary and after profiling. Remember that simplicity, readability, and modularity often lead to better performance in the long run." 

In other words, as a programmer, don't spend time trying to micro-optimize your code before you understand where the actual bottlenecks lie. Invest your energy into writing clean, well-structured code initially, because it’s easier to reason about, debug, and enhance later. Profiling tools can help identify where optimizations will have the most significant impact. Often, a straightforward and well-designed solution performs adequately without the need for premature optimizations.

- "Today's programming wisdom is to embrace the SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles serve as a foundational guide for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. They remind us to design modules with a clear purpose, make our classes open for extension but closed for modification, ensure substitutability, avoid unnecessary dependencies, and invert control where appropriate. Always remember that code is read far more often than it is written, so invest in clarity and structure."
